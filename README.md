# Hackathon-sequence-finder
**Sequence finder is an interesting game that will maximize the usage of your brain. There
will be 4 distinct color-coded quadrants in a circle. A color will blink at one of the quadrants.
The player has to identify the blink and click the correct quadrant. Next time the blink might
appear at the same or different quadrant. At this point, the player has to click the first bling area
and then the second bling area. After every blink, the player has to remember the pattern (the
area where blink appeared) from the first (start of the game) and start clicking the area
accordingly.**
